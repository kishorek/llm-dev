Johnny finds a potential buyer for the town and prepares for his family to leave. Alexis plans to move to Los Angeles and is surprised when Ted asks her to marry him, which she rejects, with the caveat that she would accept if her family was staying; she then visits Mutt's barn and has sex with him. David prepares to move to New York City and asks Stevie to move with him, but she declines, as she still has feelings for him. Roland invites the potential buyer to supper at his home before he (the buyer) can sign the contract, where the buyer falls into a coma and is unable to complete the purchase. The Roses are forced to stay, and Alexis must reckon with having cheated on Ted; David, unaware that the sale has fallen through, flees town in Roland's truck.
