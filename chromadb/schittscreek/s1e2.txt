Johnny tries to get permission from Roland to sell Schitt's Creek; Stevie invites David and Alexis to a truck party. Johnny, Moira, and David have dinner at Roland and Jocelyn Schitt's home. Alexis, trying to get over Stavros, goes to the party to find some attractive men to pose with for social media. After taking selfies with random men, she spies an attractive stranger, Mutt, at the barbecue; she kisses him, snaps some pics, and leaves. David escapes the dinner and also goes to the party, where Stevie encourages him to join in a traditional party drinking game. At the Schitt home, Roland relents and signs the contract after Moira slaps him in the style of her former soap opera persona.
