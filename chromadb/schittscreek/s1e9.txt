Bob's brother dies and he asks Johnny to deliver a eulogy, despite Johnny having never met his brother. Several relatives of the deceased arrive at the motel, much to David's chagrin; to avoid the unpleasant guests, Alexis stays at Ted's house, but becomes uncomfortable with how much he prioritizes his foster dogs. Johnny gives the eulogy but begins insulting the town until Moira begins singing "Danny Boy" to drown out his negative speech. Stevie and David smoke a joint and end up having sex.
