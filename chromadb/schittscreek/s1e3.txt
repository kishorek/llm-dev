In an attempt to make Schitt's Creek attractive to buyers, Johnny tries to have the town welcome sign, which depicts Roland's great-grandfather in a suggestive pose with his own sister, removed. Moira finds some mean comments about her online from anonymous posters and suffers an emotional meltdown; Johnny places Alexis in charge of taking care of Moira until the crisis passes. Moira accepts Jocelyn's invitation to discuss acting with the students at the local high school where Jocelyn teaches, only to break down into a series of melodramatic, self-pitying monologues. David tries to get a job at the local supermarket, but Johnny's well-intentioned phone calls sabotage him.
