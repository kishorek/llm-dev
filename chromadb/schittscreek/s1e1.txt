After their business manager steals all of their money, the Rose family are forced to move to the town of Schitt's Creek, which Johnny bought in 1991 as a joke gift for David. They take up residence in the town's motel, and immediately insult the town's pushy, oblivious mayor, Roland Schitt, and the motel's sole employee, Stevie Budd. Alexis intends to escape Schitt's Creek by taking up with her wealthy boyfriend Stavros, but he breaks up with her.
