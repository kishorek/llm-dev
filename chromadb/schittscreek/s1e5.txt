After David walks in on Johnny and Moira having sex, Roland offers Johnny and Moira the use of his cabin to get away from their children. With their parents away, Alexis talks David into having a game night but invites a large number of people—including Mutt and his girlfriend, Twyla—and turns the evening into a drunken party, upsetting David. Johnny and Moira have trouble getting into the cabin but eventually make it inside and have sex, only to find Bob and Gwen, the owners of the cabin, who reveal that Roland's cabin is further up the road. David and Stevie bond further over their shared dislike of the town's population.
